# Face_Mask_Detection
## myhaar.xml
This file was obtained by training some images with and without mask.

With mask pictures were saved in a folder named 'positive'.

Without mask pictures were saved in a folder named 'negative'.

Then a vector file of these samples were created.

Before training the model, the number of negative and positive pictures were defined.

After training the model, it was converted into an XML file.
